EFDA (Efficient Frontier with Discrete Allocations)
EFDA stands for Efficient Frontier with Discrete Allocations. In this program, the user enters 10 stock ticker symbols (ALL CAPS). From there, EFDA pulls data from Yahoo Finance. The Efficient Frontier looks at the best possible return given the standard deviation of return. The user then is asked how much they are willing to invest within the portfolio (10 companies). Once the program runs, you are given discrete allocations based on the Efficient Frontier.
